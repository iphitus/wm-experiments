pytiler2.py
* Command line based app, merely re-arranges windows depending on arguments
pytiler3.py
* Daemon. Continually arranges windows. A window arranger for window managers (ie: floating WMs that do no arranging)

* Both need a WM that has EWMH/NetWM support. Openbox is one good example, but most WMs have support to a degree.
* Both depend on wnck. This is either in gnome-python-desktop (gnome deps), or python-wnck (no gnome deps) in the AUR.

python-globalhotkeys
 * From: http://code.google.com/p/python-globalhotkeys/ 
 * A GPL/Artistic module that provides global hotkeys.
 * Added setup.py
 * Depends on gtk2 and glib

openbox
* Special support is included for openbox with window decorations entirely disabled.
* To disable decorations, add the following to the <applications> section in your rc.xml
 <application class="*">
     <decor>no</decor>
 </application>
* Openbox makes a great tiling WM and works well with these scripts.
