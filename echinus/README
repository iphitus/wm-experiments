 - Adds 'overlap' support for tiling mode. This makes tiling workable
on a small display. Windows on the right can still be used without
being resized and while keeping a tiled layout. Echinus*overlap:

 - Removes restacking in floating mode: Changing windows caused a
restack of the whole floating area, which changed the order of the
layed out windows and caused a visible flicker. Instead the patch just
raises windows.
 - Click to raise clients in sloppy+floating mode. Previously they
were only raised when moved or titlebar was clicked.
